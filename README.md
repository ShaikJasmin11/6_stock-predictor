#  Stock Price Predictor (LSTM)

> RISE Internship Project 6 â€“ Tamizhan Skills  
> Built with TensorFlow, LSTM, NumPy, and Streamlit

A deep learning-based web app that predicts the next-day closing price of selected stocks using historical trends. This is the sixth project from the **Machine Learning & AI** track of the RISE Internship by Tamizhan Skills.

---

##  Project Objective

To build a stock price forecasting system that:
  - Loads multi-stock time-series data from a CSV file
  - Scales and reshapes data into LSTM-friendly format
  - Trains an **LSTM neural network** per stock
  - Predicts the **next dayâ€™s price** using the past 60 days
  - Offers a simple **Streamlit UI** to select and forecast

---

##  Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Pandas / NumPy**
- **TensorFlow (LSTM Model)**
- **Scikit-learn (MinMaxScaler)**
- **Streamlit** (for real-time frontend UI)

##  Project Structure

```bash
stock-price-predictor/
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py                     # Streamlit frontend for real-time price prediction
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py                    # LSTM training loop for all stocks
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt           # All required packages
â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ stock_data.csv         # CSV with 5 stock columns: Stock_1 to Stock_5
â”œâ”€â”€ models/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Stock_X_model.h5       # Trained LSTM model for each stock
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Stock_X_scaler.npy     # Scaler parameters for each stock
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Stock_X_min.npy        # Minimum value for inverse scaling
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ preprocess.py          # Data loading and preparation logic
â””â”€â”€ README.md                  # Youâ€™re reading it now ðŸ˜‰

## Dataset

- Source: Stock Price Prediction Dataset â€“ Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrsimple07/stock-price-prediction)
- File: stock_data.csv
- Format:
   - Columns: empty, Stock_1, Stock_2, Stock_3, Stock_4, Stock_5
   - Each column represents historical daily closing prices for a stock
- Preprocessed using 60-day lookback windows for LSTM training

---

## How to Run

- Step 1: Install Dependencies
  
```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Step 2: Train the Model
  
```bash
  python main.py
```

- Step 3: Launch the Web App
  
```bash
  streamlit run app.py
```

## Model Performance

âœ… Predicts next-day stock prices using LSTM
âœ… Trained separately for each stock using 60-day historical windows
âœ… Scaled using MinMaxScaler for smoother convergence
âœ… Real-time forecast output from the Streamlit UI

---

## Highlights

- Uses LSTM, ideal for time-series sequence learning
- Minimal data preprocessing via MinMaxScaler
- Saves model and scaling params separately for reuse
- Streamlit app to select any of 5 stocks and get instant prediction
- Lightweight and modular codebase â€” easy to upgrade with graphs or APIs
